    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>ground beef</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>salt, pepper, parsley</li>
        <li>lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Italian sausage</li>
        <li>parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>ricotta</li>
        <li>mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat brown the ground beef and sausage together. Drain off and discard any fat. 
            Add the minced garlic and spaghetti sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the cheese mixture: ricotta, 2 cups of the mozzarella cheese, eggs, 1/2 cup of grated 
            Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt and ground black pepper. Mix well.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 3.4 cup of sauce on the bottom of the baking pan. Cover the bottom with 3 uncooked lasagna 
            noodles. Top with 1/3 of the cheese mixture and 1/4 of the sauce. Repeat layers (noodles, cheese, sauce, noodles, cheese, sauce).</li>
        <li>For the top layer, add 3 noodles, remaining sauce, remaining 1 cup of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Spray a sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray. Cover with the pan with aluminum foil (sprayed side down). 
            This prevents the cheese from sticking. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Let the lasagna stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
