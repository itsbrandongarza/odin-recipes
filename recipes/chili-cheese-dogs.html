        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These chili cheese dogs are so easy to whip up! Flavorful stewed chili is scooped onto grilled hot dogs and then 
            topped with melty cheese and crispy onions. Perfect for game day or a warm summer night.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hot Dogs</li>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Buns</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by making the chili. In a saucepan, cook down the onions until they have softened then add the beef 
                    along with the spices and cook until the beef has browned. Add the rest of the ingredients and simmer for a 
                    few minutes to let the flavors come together.</li>
                <li>Heat up the hot dogs. You have options, whatever your preference is. I like to grill them for the additional 
                    flavor and the way the grill marks look.</li>
                <li>Toast the buns. This is important! You want the buns to not just be squishy soft all the way through, 
                    toasting them with not only add flavor but also help them stand up to the chili.</li>
                <li>Assemble! To assemble the chili dogs, place a hot dog in a bun, top with mustard, then finish with the chili, 
                    cheese, and onion.</li>
            </ol>
