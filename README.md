Hello! This is a simple recipes project from The Odin Project's curriculum. It is a basic project in terms of the code and structure but this is the first HTML project in the web dev curriculum. Working on this project has allowed me to learn and apply the basic understanding of HTML elements, attributes, and web page structure.
